# PPO

Simple PPO implementation, heavily inspired from [stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).

Some of the code was also adapted from [DRLND\_Core](https://github.com/yycho0108/DRLND_core), which is one of my past projects on setting up an RL framework.
(Unfortunately, the legacy code was much too overfitted on certain architectures (DQN, discrete actions, etc.), so I sort of had to start over.)
